**Terminal game**
Start command in you terminal (ruby init.rb)

**Hello ðŸ‘‹** 

Sometimes I just play around creating simple logic games for the terminal ðŸ¥³. One of these games is the Leaderboard, which simulates the process of playing as if you were playing for real. Yes, the whole process is not fully covered here. But you can discuss it with me at any time. Each idea has its own taste and color) I didn't try to set the boundaries clearly, but I like the scalability.
